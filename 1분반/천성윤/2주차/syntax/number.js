console.log('In fields of gold, where sunlight beams,We chase the echoes of our dreams. Unshackled hearts, so \
    wild and free,    We dance to tunes of liberty. No chains to bind, no walls to cage,    We write our story, \
    page by page.In every breath, in every sigh,    We taste the freedom of the sky.     Happiness, a gentle\
    breeze,    That whispers through the rustling trees.It fills our hearts, it lifts our souls,    It makes us\
    feel completely whole.With every step on paths uncharted,    We find new joys, pure and unguarded.The open\
    road, the endless sea,    A testament to being free.  So let us soar on wings of light,    Embrace the\
    day, embrace the night.For in the realm where free hearts fly,    We find our happiness, and sigh.'.length);
